# Labyrinth
This project is based on the game Labyrinth by Ravensburger. The game is not an exact copy but the aim of the project was not to provide something new or unique but to demonstrate my JavaScript potential.

Checked compatibility:
- Chrome 61+
- Firefox 55+
- MS Edge 40+

Not working with:
- Internet Explorer
- Safari

Known bugs:
- The lack of collectable treasures in the game (score system)
- The player sizes are not responsive
- If players cover each other, one will be perfectly hidden
- The lack of touchscreen support
